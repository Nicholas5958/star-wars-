<h5 style="color:#ffff4d">Kyber crystals are used for lightsabers, the kyber krystals act as the energy to produce the light from the saber.
With these kyber krystals their exist multiple colors and each color has a different meaning.
</h5>
<ul style="color:#ffff4d">
<li>Red is commonly used for the sith a common way for the sith to create their kyber krystal is to, take a jedi's krystal and bleed 
it red hence its red color</li>
<li>Blue is common within the jedi blue stands for a jedi guardian a person who used the more physical aspect of the force.</li>
<li>Unlike the previous color blue green represents one more intuned with the spirutal side of the force</li>
<li>Orange krystals are much weaker than other krystals this crystal represents a jedi who doesn't believe in violence unless absolutely necsercary hence why this type of
krystal/lightsaber was weaker than the others.</li>
<li>White krystals represent a purified krystal if you remeber what was said about the red krystal
and how its bleeded to become red the white crystal is what happens when someone purifies a red krystal its purifacation becomes white.</li>
<li>Yellow is pretty simple it stand for someone with lost identity, this color is most commonly seen with jedi temple guards.</li>
<li>The black krystal also known as darksaber is rare with only one existing the darksaber can
read the emotions of its user and can be very powerful in the hands of someone mentally strong but in the hands of someone weak
it's pretty much usless. A very fun fact is that whoever holds the darksaber controls mandalore.</li>
</ul>

<ul style="color:#ffff4d">
<i style="color:#ffff4d"><b>Form I: Shii-Cho</b></i>
<i><b>Form II: Makashi</b></i>
<i><b>Form III: Soresu</b></i>
<i><b>Form IV: Ataru</b></i>
<i><b>Form V: Shien/Djem So</b></i>
<i><b>Form VI: Niman</b></i>
<i><b>Form VII: Juyo/Vaapad</b></i>
<i><b>Jar'Kai</b></i>
<hr>

</ul>

<ul style="color:#ffff4d">

<li>Shii-Cho is form that uses that strikes and swings, to put it simply 
an unpredictible form.</li>
<li>Makashi is an elegant form that uses controlled and well thought out
strikes and blocks.</li>
<li>Soresu is a mainly defensive form that specializes in blocks and counters</li>
<li>Ataru unlike soresu that utilizes the force in conjunction with your moves the downfall 
being that its very tiresome.</li>
<li>Shien/Djem is a very offense form tht gives your opponent no time to react its only weakness is it's
lack of moblity that was later on changed by the chosen one anakin skywalker.</li>
<li>Niman was common form among jedi not much to say about this form, as the only thing,
to say is that it's balanced between offense and defense.</li>
<li>Juyo/Vaapad used are both agressive forms while juyo has its flaw of most people using it's
ability to flirt with the darkside fell victom to said darkside jedi master Windu developed 
vaapad to channel one's darkside power and use their opponets dark side against them.</li>
<li>Jar'Kai is a form that simply utilizes two lightsabers instead of the average one.</li>

</ul>

<h2 style="color:#ffff4d">Strongest Jedi/Sith</h2>
 In this list I will say who I personally consider to be in the top 5 Jedi/Sith list.
 <img src="https://marciokenobi.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/star-wars.jpg" alt="Semrush logo 1" width="250" height="250">

 
 <ol style="color:#ffff4d">
<li>Full Power/Potential Anakin Skywalker</li>
<li>Grandmaster Luke</li>
<li>Palpatine/Darth Sidious</li>
<li>Yoda</li>
<li>Darth Bane</li>
 </ol>
<hr style="color:#ffff4d">

<ul style="color:#ffff4d">
<li>Anakin aka the chosen one has the highest midiclorian and on mortis was able to control
The Son and The Daughter who are the strongest force beings in the star wars universe.</li>
<li>In the Legends years after the battle on the second death star Luke had became
the grandmaster of the next generation of jedi and is considered in the community
to be either the strongest or second strongest depending if you think he beats anakin.</li>
<li>Palpatine/Darth Sidious is widly considered by people (including me) to be the strongest
Sith of all time especially in rise of skywalker where he was buffed by Rey and Ben's Force diad,
The planet Exgor, and his acholites.</li>
<li>Yoda can be considered the strongest Jedi of his time even being able to give darth Sidious
in <b>Revenge of the Sith</b> a run for his money.</li>
<li>Darth bane is a very powerful Sith who when the Sith were near defeat was able to revolutionize
them and make them more powerful, Also being the one to create the rule of 2.</li>
</ul>
