              In this list I talked about Force abilities that ablity and 
              I beleived to be the stongest of the ones present and that, I could
              find. A few you might heard would be force lighting and force drain(if you 
              know about darth nihilus, As those were either in the preqels or talked
              about of alot from star wars fans.

             <p style="color:#0000ff;">  
            The light side of the force is predominantly used by Jedi and is considered to be,
            by the statements of Obi Wan- "It feels like turning on the lights in the darkness"
            The lightside of the force houses the more positive emotions. The lightside also comes
            wih it's perks that being that after death and if you lived a life of dedication to force
            you can project your force spirit into the physical, Most star wars fans and characters can
            agree that this acheivment is essentially immortality.

            <p style="color:#ff0000;">  
            The dark side of the force is predominantly used by Sith and is the darker version
            of the force that rewards selfish behavior. The dark side is fueld by rage,sorrow, and fear
            The dark side comes with it's faults though as having conflict can completly dimish ones strength.
            Unlike the light the dark side to our knowledge is cabple of the same immortality force projection
            but rather has a worser immortality by only being able to store their essence in a single object.

                A pretyy short explnation. The Force is a mysterious energy field created by life that binds the galaxy together.
                Harnessing the power of the Force gives the Jedi, the Sith, and others sensitive to this spiritual energy extraordinary abilities, 
                such as levitating objects, tricking minds, and seeing things before they happen
